## 1. What is Poverty

* Poverty has been traditionally defined in **economic terms** — focusing on **income, property, and living standards**.
* A person is considered **poor** when their **income is insufficient** to meet **basic needs**: **food, shelter, and clothing**.

---

## Beyond Income: A Multidimensional View

* Modern perspectives view poverty as a **complex, multidimensional phenomenon** involving **sociological, political, psychological, and geographical** factors.
* Income is just one aspect; poverty also results from **limited access to education, healthcare, and social networks**, restricting full human potential.

---

## Measuring Poverty: Different Approaches

### • Absolute Poverty

* Defines a **fixed minimum income level** (poverty line) necessary to meet **basic needs**.
* Indicators include **calorie intake**, **housing quality**, and **access to healthcare**.

### • Relative Poverty

* Defines poverty **in relation to societal living standards**, where the poverty line **shifts** based on **societal norms and expectations**.
* Example: Someone poor in the **United States** might not be classified as poor in **India**, due to differing living standards.

## 2. Poverty Line

* The poverty line defines the **minimum income, consumption, or access to goods/services** required to be considered non-poor.
* It is calculated based on **expenditure** needed for an **adequate diet, clothing, and shelter**.
* In India, emphasis is laid on the **cost of food** meeting **minimum calorie requirements**.
* **World Bank's International Poverty Line (IPL)** was updated to **\$1.90 per day in 2015**.

## 2.1 Evolution of Poverty Estimation in India

### • Lakdawala Expert Group (1993)

* Recommended **state-specific poverty lines** using **different Consumer Price Indices** (CPI) for industrial and agricultural workers to account for regional variations.

### • Tendulkar Expert Group (2009)

* Shifted methodology from **calorie intake norms** to **broader nutritional outcomes**.
* Introduced a **uniform all-India poverty line**.
* Included **private expenditure** on **health** and **education**.

### • Rangarajan Committee (2014)

* Proposed **separate rural and urban poverty baskets**.
* Included detailed **food and non-food items** to reflect diverse consumption needs.

### • NITI Aayog Task Force (2015)

* Recommended **tracking the bottom 30% population**, not just those officially below the poverty line.
* Suggested monitoring **material deprivation** in areas like **nutrition**, **housing**, and **connectivity**.

---

## Challenges in Establishing a Poverty Line

* **Cost of Basic Needs**: Complex due to **regional differences**, **inflation**, and **changing consumption patterns**.
* **Calorie Intake vs. Nutritional Outcomes**:

  * Earlier methods emphasized **minimum calories**;
  * Modern approaches focus on **overall nutritional health** to ensure better living standards.

## 2.2 National MPI by NITI Aayog

* **NITI Aayog** developed the **National MPI**, modeled on the **Global MPI**.
* Retains **10 original indicators** + adds **Maternal Health** and **Bank Account** (aligned with India's national priorities).
* Purpose:

  * **Targeted, inclusive poverty interventions**.
  * **Identification of overlapping deprivations**.
  * **Inclusive policy formulation**.

---

## Structure of MPI

### ➔ Three Dimensions:

* **Health**
* **Education**
* **Living Standards**

### ➔ Ten Global Indicators:

* **Health**: Nutrition, Child Mortality
* **Education**: Years of Schooling, School Attendance
* **Living Standards**: Cooking Fuel, Sanitation, Drinking Water, Electricity, Housing (Floor), Assets

*(India’s National MPI adds: **Maternal Health** and **Bank Account**)*

---

## Key Findings (NITI Aayog Report 2023)

* **14.96%** of India's population suffers from **multidimensional poverty**.
* India among **25 nations** to **halve MPI** within **15 years**.
* **415 million** people moved out of poverty (2005/06 to 2019/21).
* **Incidence of poverty** reduced from **55.1%** to **16.4%**.
* **Deprivation** levels declined across all indicators.

---

## Global MPI Context

* **Global MPI** assesses **acute multidimensional poverty** across **110+ developing countries**.

---

## Challenges in NMPI

* **Low Sensitivity**: Threshold (deprived in ≥1/3 indicators) may miss smaller deprivations.
* **COVID-19 Impact**: Might not fully capture pandemic's effects on health and livelihood.
* **Stagnant Wages**: Questions consistency of poverty reduction despite stagnant real incomes.

---

## Way Forward

* **Expand Dimensions**: Add learning outcomes, social discrimination, environmental factors.
* **Update Data**: Use recent **NSS** and **NFHS** surveys.
* **Effective Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of deprivation indicators.
* **Social Audits** and **Awareness Campaigns**: Strengthen poverty alleviation programs.
