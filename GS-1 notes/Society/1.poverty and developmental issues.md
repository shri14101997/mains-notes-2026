## Status of Poverty in India

### Incidence of Poverty (Historical Trends):

| Year | Poverty Rate |
| :--: | :----------: |
| 1947 |      80%     |
| 1973 |      55%     |
| 1993 |      36%     |
| 2011 |     21.9%    |

---

### Multidimensional Poverty:

* **NITI Aayog MPI Report (2021)**:
  ➔ **25.01%** of India's population is multidimensionally poor.

* **Global MPI 2022**:
  ➔ **415 million** people escaped multidimensional poverty (2005–06 to 2019–21).
  ➔ Poverty incidence dropped from **55.1%** to **16.4%**.

* **Vulnerability**:
  ➔ **18.7%** (approx. 260.9 million people, 2020) classified as **vulnerable to multidimensional poverty**.

---

### Intensity of Poverty:

* **World Bank (2019)**:
  ➔ Number of extremely poor decreased by **12.3%** between **2011 and 2019**.

---

### Regional Variations:

| High Poverty States | Poverty Rate | Low Poverty States | Poverty Rate |
| :------------------ | :----------- | :----------------- | :----------- |
| Bihar               | 51.91%       | Kerala             | 0.71%        |

## Beyond Income: A Multidimensional View

* Modern perspectives view poverty as a **complex, multidimensional phenomenon** involving **sociological, political, psychological, and geographical** factors.
* Income is just one aspect; poverty also results from **limited access to education, healthcare, and social networks**, restricting full human potential.

---

## Measuring Poverty: Different Approaches

### • Absolute Poverty

* Defines a **fixed minimum income level** (poverty line) necessary to meet **basic needs**.
* Indicators include **calorie intake**, **housing quality**, and **access to healthcare**.

### • Relative Poverty

* Defines poverty **in relation to societal living standards**, where the poverty line **shifts** based on **societal norms and expectations**.
* Example: Someone poor in the **United States** might not be classified as poor in **India**, due to differing living standards.


---

## 2. Poverty Line

* The poverty line defines the **minimum income, consumption, or access to goods/services** required to be considered non-poor.
* It is calculated based on **expenditure** needed for an **adequate diet, clothing, and shelter**.
* In India, emphasis is laid on the **cost of food** meeting **minimum calorie requirements**.
* **World Bank's International Poverty Line (IPL)** was updated to **\$1.90 per day in 2015**.

---

## 2.1 Evolution of Poverty Estimation in India

### • Lakdawala Expert Group (1993)

* Recommended **state-specific poverty lines** using **different Consumer Price Indices** (CPI) for industrial and agricultural workers to account for regional variations.

### • Tendulkar Expert Group (2009)

* Shifted methodology from **calorie intake norms** to **broader nutritional outcomes**.
* Introduced a **uniform all-India poverty line**.
* Included **private expenditure** on **health** and **education**.

### • Rangarajan Committee (2014)

* Proposed **separate rural and urban poverty baskets**.
* Included detailed **food and non-food items** to reflect diverse consumption needs.

### • NITI Aayog Task Force (2015)

* Recommended **tracking the bottom 30% population**, not just those officially below the poverty line.
* Suggested monitoring **material deprivation** in areas like **nutrition**, **housing**, and **connectivity**.

---

## Challenges in Establishing a Poverty Line

* **Cost of Basic Needs**: Complex due to **regional differences**, **inflation**, and **changing consumption patterns**.
* **Calorie Intake vs. Nutritional Outcomes**:

  * Earlier methods emphasized **minimum calories**;
  * Modern approaches focus on **overall nutritional health** to ensure better living standards.

---


## 2.2 National MPI by NITI Aayog

* **NITI Aayog** developed the **National MPI**, modeled on the **Global MPI**.
* Retains **10 original indicators** + adds **Maternal Health** and **Bank Account** (aligned with India's national priorities).
* Purpose:

  * **Targeted, inclusive poverty interventions**.
  * **Identification of overlapping deprivations**.
  * **Inclusive policy formulation**.

---

## Structure of MPI

### ➔ Three Dimensions:

* **Health**
* **Education**
* **Living Standards**

### ➔ Ten Global Indicators:

* **Health**: Nutrition, Child Mortality
* **Education**: Years of Schooling, School Attendance
* **Living Standards**: Cooking Fuel, Sanitation, Drinking Water, Electricity, Housing (Floor), Assets

*(India’s National MPI adds: **Maternal Health** and **Bank Account**)*

---

## Key Findings (NITI Aayog Report 2023)

* **14.96%** of India's population suffers from **multidimensional poverty**.
* India among **25 nations** to **halve MPI** within **15 years**.
* **415 million** people moved out of poverty (2005/06 to 2019/21).
* **Incidence of poverty** reduced from **55.1%** to **16.4%**.
* **Deprivation** levels declined across all indicators.

---

## Global MPI Context

* **Global MPI** assesses **acute multidimensional poverty** across **110+ developing countries**.

---

## Challenges in NMPI

* **Low Sensitivity**: Threshold (deprived in ≥1/3 indicators) may miss smaller deprivations.
* **COVID-19 Impact**: Might not fully capture pandemic's effects on health and livelihood.
* **Stagnant Wages**: Questions consistency of poverty reduction despite stagnant real incomes.

---

## Way Forward

* **Expand Dimensions**: Add learning outcomes, social discrimination, environmental factors.
* **Update Data**: Use recent **NSS** and **NFHS** surveys.
* **Effective Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of deprivation indicators.
* **Social Audits** and **Awareness Campaigns**: Strengthen poverty alleviation programs.

---



## 2.3 Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC)

* **State governments** are responsible for identifying poor households using **Below Poverty Line (BPL) censuses**.
* The **latest comprehensive data** available is from the **Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011**.

---

## Significance of SECC

* **Identification of Poor Households**:
  ➔ SECC data is crucial for **effective targeting** of beneficiaries under **poverty alleviation programs**.

* **Multidimensional Approach**:
  ➔ SECC goes beyond **income criteria**, considering **housing conditions**, **education levels**, and **basic amenities** to assess deprivation.

---


## Distinct Characteristics of Poverty in India 

---

## 1. Rural-Urban Divide

* **Rural areas** are more impoverished than urban areas.
* **Poverty ratio**:
  ➔ **32.75%** rural vs **8.81%** urban (*NITI Aayog MPI, 2021*).
* Rural population largely dependent on **low-productivity agriculture**.

---

  * Restricts **social mobility**, perpetuating poverty.

---

### • Regional Variations

* **Poverty Levels**:

  * Higher in **Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh**.
  * Lower in **Kerala, Goa**.
    (*Tendulkar Committee Report 2011*)

* **Causes**:

  * Historical disadvantages, low **infrastructure investment**, **geographical constraints** (droughts, floods).

* **Impact**:

  * Creates **economic disparity** among states.
  * Calls for **targeted policies** and **resource allocation**.

---

### • Caste and Religion Intersection

* **Findings**:

  * **SCs and STs** show **higher poverty rates** than upper castes.
    (*National Socioeconomic Survey 2011*)

* **Causes**:

  * Historical relegation to **low-wage jobs**.
  * **Discrimination** in education, employment, and land access.

* **Impact**:

  * **Socio-economic marginalization** continues across generations.

---

### • Feminization of Poverty

* **Definition**: Increasing share of **women among the poor** due to **systemic gender inequality**.

---


## 3.2 Vicious Circle Theory

* Poverty traps individuals in circumstances that make escaping poverty difficult.

---

### Causes:

* **Low Levels of Education**:
  ➔ Poverty limits access to quality education.
  ➔ Children often attend **under-resourced schools** with a **student-teacher ratio of 60:1** (*UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2021*), restricting skill development for better employment.

* **Poor Health and Malnutrition**:
  ➔ Chronic malnutrition among **tribal children in Madhya Pradesh** linked to **low school enrollment** and **limited future opportunities** (*Centre for Chronic Poverty Studies, 2019*).
  ➔ Highlights **intergenerational transmission** of poverty.

* **High Fertility Rates**:
  ➔ India's **Total Fertility Rate (TFR)** = **2.0**, but higher in poverty-ridden states (*Population Reference Bureau, 2021*).
  ➔ High fertility strains family resources, limiting investment in each child's **education and well-being**, sustaining poverty across generations.

---


## 3.3 Geographical Factors

* Poverty can arise due to **geographical conditions** like **resource scarcity** in **desert** and **hill areas**, making economic development difficult.

---
![alt text](image.png)
### Causes:

* **Regional Disparity**:
  ➔ Poverty is uneven across India.
  ➔ **Bihar**: **51.9% poverty rate**, **Goa**: **5.1%** (*SECC 2011*).

* **Natural Disasters**:
  ➔ India faces frequent **floods, droughts, cyclones**.
  ➔ **2.4 million** people pushed into poverty annually due to disasters (*World Bank Report, 2020*).

* **Climate Change Impact**:
  ➔ Climate change could push an additional **36 million Indians into poverty by 2030** (*International Food Policy Research Institute, 2022*).

---


## 4. Consequences of Poverty

* Poverty impacts **individuals, families, and society**, creating a **vicious cycle** that is hard to escape.

---

### Key Social Consequences:

* **Culture of Poverty**:
  ➔ Poverty becomes **ingrained across generations**.
  ➔ Limited access to **education**, **employment**, and **housing** leads to **hopelessness** and discourages initiative.

* **Effects on Health**:
  ➔ Poor living conditions, malnutrition, and lack of healthcare raise **infant mortality**, **disease vulnerability**, and **mental health issues**.
  ➔ *WHO Report 2020*:

  * People in the **lowest income quintile live 18 fewer years** than richest.

* **Stolen Childhoods**:
  ➔ *UNICEF 2021 Report*:

  * **606 million children** live in extreme poverty.

  * **Limited Education**:
    ➔ Poor schooling infrastructure hampers children's academic growth.

  * **Child Labor**:
    ➔ Poverty forces children into work, sacrificing education.

  * **Early Marriage**:
    ➔ Poor girls are **2.5 times more likely** to marry young, harming education and health.

* **Social Exclusion and Stigma**:
  ➔ Poverty leads to **ostracization**, limits **community participation**, and deepens **marginalization**.

* **Psychological Effects**:
  ➔ Continuous struggle causes **low self-esteem**, **hopelessness**, **stress**, and **anxiety**.
