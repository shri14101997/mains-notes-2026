### 1.  Urbanization and Urban Transition in India

---

## What is Urbanization?

* **Urbanization** = Rise in the proportion of people living in **urban areas** (*World Bank*).

---

## Urban Area Classification in India

* **Statutory Town**: Area governed by **municipal body** (corporation, council, nagar panchayat).
* **Census Town**:

  * Population ≥ **5,000**.
  * **≥75% male workforce** in **non-agricultural activities**.
  * **Population density** ≥ **400 persons/sq km**.

---

## Urban Transition Data

* **Population (2011)**: **1210 million**.
* **Urbanization Level**: **31.1%** (*Census 2011*).
* **Global Share**: India holds **11%** of **world’s urban population**.
* **Future Projection**: India will be **50% urban by 2050** (*UN-Habitat, 2017*).

---

## Undercounting of Urbanization

* **Statutory towns** rose by only **5%** (2001–2011).
* **Census towns** surged by **185%**.
* **Result**: Official data **underrepresents real urbanization**.

---

### 2. Drivers of Urbanization

---

## 1. Social and Cultural Pull Factors

* **Better living standards**, **educational opportunities**, **cultural amenities**.
* **Social mobility** and exposure to **diverse experiences** drive people toward cities.

---

## 2. Technological Advancements

* Improvements in **transportation** and **communication infrastructure**.
* **Easier population movement** and **economic exchange**.

---

## 3. Economic Factors

* **Industrialization** creates jobs and attracts businesses.
* **Service sector** growth diversifies urban economies.

---

## Summary Line

* Urbanization is not just a **demographic shift**, but a **dynamic process** transforming societies across multiple dimensions.

---


### 3. Urbanisation as a Process

---

## 1.1 Urbanization as a Social and Cultural Process

* **Acculturation**: Migrants adopt dominant urban culture; traditional structures weaken.
* **Diffusion of Urban Culture**: Urban values spread to rural areas via media, migration, interactions.
* **Education & Social Mobility**: Urban areas enable new hierarchies based on education over caste.

### Urbanism (Way of Urban Life)

* **Social Interactions**: Anonymity, professional networks > kinship ties.
* **Heterogeneity**: Cities = diverse ethnicities, classes; opportunities + social tensions.
* **Fast-paced Lifestyle**: Focus on speed, efficiency, achievements; stressful yet stimulating.
* **Material Culture**: Defined by modern architecture, transport, technology access.

---

## 1.2 Urbanization as a Political-Administrative Process

* **Shifting Power Dynamics**: Urban voters gain influence, decentralizing power.
* **Governance Challenges**: Infrastructure lags behind rapid expansion → slums, overcrowding, unrest.
* **New Social Movements**: Cities become hubs for activism (labor rights, environment, social justice).

---

## 1.3 Urbanization as an Economic Process

* **Job Creation**: Cities drive employment, industries, finance — boosting national GDP.
* **Informal Sector Growth**: Rise in unregulated activities (street vending, small-scale industries).

---

## 1.4 Urbanization as a Geographical Process

* **Physical Expansion**: Cities expand boundaries; new towns rise around industries and transport hubs.

---



### Nature of Urbanisation in India 

---

## Key Characteristics:

* **Migration-Driven**: Rural-to-urban migration (not industrialization like developed nations).
* **Breakneck Pace**: Rapid influx → strain on housing, sanitation, transportation → unplanned sprawl.
* **Vicious Cycle**: Lack of planning → worsens urban chaos.

---

## Sub-Urbanization:

* Expansion of rural areas around cities for non-agricultural uses.
* **Example**: Delhi — sharp rise in urban land use, municipal expansion, improved connectivity.

---

## Conurbations:

* Narrow strip of urban settlements along major roads/railways.
* **Examples**:

  * **NCR**: Delhi + Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad.
  * **Kolkata Metropolitan Area**: Kolkata + Howrah, Hooghly, North 24 Parganas.

---

## Uneven and Dispersed Growth:

* Coastal areas and economic hubs urbanize faster.
* Exacerbates **regional disparities**, affecting national development balance.

---

## Urban Sprawls:

* Uncontrolled city expansion into rural lands.
* Causes: Lack of planning, population boom, migration, weak policies.

---

## Rise of Mega-Cities and Tier-2 Cities:

* **Mega-Cities**: Mumbai, Delhi (global-scale metros).
* **Tier-2 Boom**: Cities like Pune, Ahmedabad growing fast but facing congestion, pollution, strained social fabric.

---

## Persistence of Informal Sector:

* Large urban workforce in informal jobs (street vendors, construction, domestic workers).
* Challenges: Job insecurity, no social security benefits.

---


###  Effects of Urbanisation on Social Structure and Institutions 

---

## 3.1 Family and Kinship:

* **Shift to Nuclear Families**: Economic pressure + smaller spaces → decline of joint families.
* **Isolation Risk**: Weakening of traditional kinship ties.
* **Changing Roles**: Women participating in workforce → shared household responsibilities; but balancing work-family is a challenge.

---

## 3.2 Women:

* **Greater Opportunities**: More access to education, employment → increased independence.
* **Persistent Issues**: Gender-based violence, lack of childcare support, unequal pay.

---

## 3.3 Children:

* **Better Access**: Improved education and healthcare.
* **Challenges Remain**: Child labor, street children issues, poor sanitation in slums.

---

## 3.4 Caste:

* **Reduced Rigidity**: Urban living dilutes strict caste barriers somewhat.
* **Ongoing Discrimination**: Biases in housing, jobs, and social spaces persist, especially for lower castes.

---

## Conclusion:

Urbanisation reshapes social institutions — offers **progressive opportunities** but also creates **new challenges** requiring **policy attention and social reform**.

---


### Challenges and Issues of Urbanisation in India

---

## 1. Overcrowding and Housing Shortage:

* **Severe Overcrowding**: 85–90% households in cities like Mumbai, Pune live in 1–2 rooms (Census 2011).
* **Urban Housing Deficit**: 20 million unit shortage (MoHUA, 2018).
* **Factors**:
  → Rural distress & migration
  → Fragmented land ownership
  → Restrictive FSI & rent laws
  → Lack of housing loans for informal workers
  → Poor land records.
* **Rise of Slums**: 17.3% urban population in slums (Census 2011); *Dharavi* houses 1 million people in 2.4 sq km.
* **Health Impact**: Higher TB rates in slums (PHFI 2015).
* **Social Impact**:
  → Oscar Lewis' "Culture of Poverty" theory: cycle of poverty.
  → Women’s safety concerns due to overcrowded slums.
* **Economic Impact**:
  → Productivity loss due to long commutes.
  → Talent migration hindered, slowing economic growth.

---

## 2. Strained Infrastructure:

* **Water Supply Crisis**: Only 58% of urban India has piped water (World Bank, 2019).
* **Overburdened**: Sanitation, transport, electricity severely lag behind population growth.

---

## 3. Environmental Degradation:

* **Pollution Spike**: 14 Indian cities among top 20 most polluted globally (WHO, 2020).
* **Water Pollution**: Industrial waste + sewage polluting rivers.

---

## 4. Social Issues:

* **Marginalization**: Migrants stuck in informal low-wage jobs → social alienation.
* **Disrupted Social Fabric**:
  → Weaker family ties, loss of rural support networks.
  → Caste-based discrimination persists.
  → Rise in crime, juvenile delinquency.
