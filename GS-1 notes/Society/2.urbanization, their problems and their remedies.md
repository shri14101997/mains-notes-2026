### 1.  Urbanization and Urban Transition in India

---

## What is Urbanization?

* **Urbanization** = Rise in the proportion of people living in **urban areas** (*World Bank*).

---

## Urban Area Classification in India

* **Statutory Town**: Area governed by **municipal body** (corporation, council, nagar panchayat).
* **Census Town**:

  * Population ≥ **5,000**.
  * **≥75% male workforce** in **non-agricultural activities**.
  * **Population density** ≥ **400 persons/sq km**.

---

## Urban Transition Data

* **Population (2011)**: **1210 million**.
* **Urbanization Level**: **31.1%** (*Census 2011*).
* **Global Share**: India holds **11%** of **world’s urban population**.
* **Future Projection**: India will be **50% urban by 2050** (*UN-Habitat, 2017*).

---

## Undercounting of Urbanization

* **Statutory towns** rose by only **5%** (2001–2011).
* **Census towns** surged by **185%**.
* **Result**: Official data **underrepresents real urbanization**.

### 2. Drivers of Urbanization

---

## 1. Social and Cultural Pull Factors

* **Better living standards**, **educational opportunities**, **cultural amenities**.
* **Social mobility** and exposure to **diverse experiences** drive people toward cities.

---

## 2. Technological Advancements

* Improvements in **transportation** and **communication infrastructure**.
* **Easier population movement** and **economic exchange**.

---

## 3. Economic Factors

* **Industrialization** creates jobs and attracts businesses.
* **Service sector** growth diversifies urban economies.

---

## Summary Line

* Urbanization is not just a **demographic shift**, but a **dynamic process** transforming societies across multiple dimensions.

### 3. Urbanisation as a Process

---

## 1.1 Urbanization as a Social and Cultural Process

* **Acculturation**: Migrants adopt dominant urban culture; traditional structures weaken.
* **Diffusion of Urban Culture**: Urban values spread to rural areas via media, migration, interactions.
* **Education & Social Mobility**: Urban areas enable new hierarchies based on education over caste.

### Urbanism (Way of Urban Life)

* **Social Interactions**: Anonymity, professional networks > kinship ties.
* **Heterogeneity**: Cities = diverse ethnicities, classes; opportunities + social tensions.
* **Fast-paced Lifestyle**: Focus on speed, efficiency, achievements; stressful yet stimulating.
* **Material Culture**: Defined by modern architecture, transport, technology access.

---

## 1.2 Urbanization as a Political-Administrative Process

* **Shifting Power Dynamics**: Urban voters gain influence, decentralizing power.
* **Governance Challenges**: Infrastructure lags behind rapid expansion → slums, overcrowding, unrest.
* **New Social Movements**: Cities become hubs for activism (labor rights, environment, social justice).

---

## 1.3 Urbanization as an Economic Process

* **Job Creation**: Cities drive employment, industries, finance — boosting national GDP.
* **Informal Sector Growth**: Rise in unregulated activities (street vending, small-scale industries).

---

## 1.4 Urbanization as a Geographical Process

* **Physical Expansion**: Cities expand boundaries; new towns rise around industries and transport hubs.
